### Hi there 👋
My name is George, I am a Junior Software Developer who has been living in Edinburgh, UK since December 2022.

I'm a highly motivated software developer with a passion for coding and proficiency in Java, Python, and JavaScript.

In July 2023 I started my journey to became a software developer by joining the 16-week professional software developer bootcamp at CodeClan.
One month later (week 5) CodeClan went into liquidation (lucky us!), but thankfully with the help of our
instructors/ Staff members/ FanDuel/ CodeBase/ Scottish Gov 
we managed to continue our studies. Now after 2 projects and on week 12 we're learning Java (which I loooooved since day 1).

- 💬 Ask me about my project/code, I am open to suggestions or improvemt tips. I always try to produce quality code.

- ⚡ Fun fact: During my military duty back in Greece I received the speciality of Minesweeper 💣 👀
