### Hi there 👋
My name is George, I live in Edinburgh since december 2022.

I'm a highly motivated software developer with passion for coding and a proficiency in Java, Python, and JavaScript.

At July 2023 I Started my journy to became a software developer by joining the 16 week bootcamp at CodeClan.
One month later (week 5) CodeClan went into liquidation (lucky us), thankfully with the help of 
instructors/ Staff members/ FanDuel/ CodeBase/ Scottish Gov 
we managed to continue our studies, now after 2 projects and week 12 we learn about Java (which I loooooved since day 1).
